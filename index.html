            <h3>A student of CSE engineering</h3>
            <p>Hi there! I am a student of Bangladesh Army International University of Science and technology. Now I am
                in
                the 7th semester of my BSc course.Starting a career as a successful computer engineer can lead to a
                rewarding and lucrative career path. Computer science and engineering principles will continue to be
                applied
                to new applications, environments, and situations where human beings can utilize computational powers to
                improve product quality and service levels.If youâ€™re still deciding your major in university, there is
                no
                denying that computer engineering programs will contribute to a future full of job opportunities. But if
                you're wondering how to get that engineering degree or how to build a career in computer engineering,
                then
                it's worth reviewing how other professionals in the field achieved success in their careers. Discover
                how
                these computer engineers made a successful career for themselves.
